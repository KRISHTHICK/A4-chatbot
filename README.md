To create a chatbot that can answer queries related to financial documents you uploaded, you can follow these steps:

Set up a repository: Ensure your repository is ready to host the chatbot code and financial documents.

Upload financial documents: Upload the financial documents to a specific directory in your repository.

Create a chatbot script: Develop a script to handle user queries and fetch relevant information from the financial documents.

Use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model: Integrate an NLP model to understand and process user queries. You can use libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or pre-built models like OpenAI GPT-3.

Deploy the chatbot: Host the chatbot on a server or cloud service to make it accessible to users.

Here's an example implementation using Python and OpenAI's GPT-3:

Step 1: Set up the repository
Make sure your repository is initialized and ready to host your files.

Step 2: Upload financial documents
Create a directory called financial_documents and upload your documents there.

Step 3: Create a chatbot script
Create a Python script chatbot.py with the following code:

Python
import openai
import os

# Load your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

def load_documents(directory):
    documents = {}
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith(".txt"):
            with open(os.path.join(directory, filename), 'r') as file:
                documents[filename] = file.read()
    return documents

def answer_query(query, documents):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci",
        prompt=f"Answer the following query based on the provided documents: {query}\n\nDocuments:\n{documents}",
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

def main():
    documents = load_documents('financial_documents')
    while True:
        query = input("Enter your query: ")
        answer = answer_query(query, documents)
        print(f"Answer: {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Step 4: Create a requirements file
Create a requirements.txt file with the following content to install necessary dependencies:

Code
openai
Step 5: Deploy the chatbot
You can deploy the chatbot script on a server or cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.

Heroku Deployment Example:

Install the Heroku CLI.
Create a Procfile with the following content:
Code
web: python chatbot.py
Deploy the repository to Heroku.
AWS or Google Cloud:

Set up a virtual machine or a container.
Install necessary dependencies.
Run the chatbot.py script.
Ensure you have set your OpenAI API key in the environment variables on the server or cloud service.

Now, your chatbot should be able to answer queries related to the financial documents you uploaded.
